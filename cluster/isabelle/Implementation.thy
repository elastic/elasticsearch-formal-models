subsection \<open>Protocol messages\<close>

text \<open>The
proven-safe core of the protocol works by sending messages as described here. The remainder of the
protocol may send other messages too, and may drop, reorder or duplicate any of these messages, but
must not send these messages itself to ensure safety. Another way of thinking of these messages is
to consider them as ``fire-and-forget'' RPC invocations that, on receipt, call some local method, maybe
update the receiving node's state, and maybe yield some further messages. The @{type nat} parameter to each
message refers to a slot number.\<close>


datatype Message
  = StartJoin Term
  | JoinRequest Slot Term "Term option"
  | ClientValue Value
  | PublishRequest Slot Term Value
  | PublishResponse Slot Term
  | ApplyCommit Slot Term
  | CatchUpRequest
  | CatchUpResponse Slot "Node set" ClusterState
  | Reboot

text \<open>Some prose descriptions of these messages follows, in order to give a bit more of an
intuitive understanding of their purposes.\<close>

text \<open>The message @{term "StartJoin t"} may be sent by any node to attempt to start a master
election in the given term @{term t}.\<close>

text \<open>The message @{term "JoinRequest i t a"} may be sent by a node in response
to a @{term StartJoin} message. It indicates that the sender knows all committed values for slots
strictly below @{term i}, and that the sender will no longer vote (i.e. send an @{term
PublishResponse}) in any term prior to @{term t}. The field @{term a} is either @{term
None} or @{term "Some t'"}. In the former case this indicates that
the node has not yet sent any @{term PublishResponse} message in slot @{term i}, and in the latter
case it indicates that the largest term in which it has previously sent an @{term PublishResponse}
message is @{term t'}.  All
nodes must avoid sending a @{term JoinRequest} message to two different masters in the same term.\<close>

text \<open>The message @{term "ClientValue x"} may be sent by any node and indicates an attempt to
reach consensus on the value @{term x}.\<close>

text \<open>The message @{term "PublishRequest i t v"} may be sent by the elected master of term
@{term t} to request the other master-eligible nodes to vote for value @{term v} to be committed in
slot @{term i}.\<close>

text \<open>The message @{term "PublishResponse i t"} may be sent by node in response to
the corresponding @{term PublishRequest} message, indicating that the sender votes for the value
proposed by the master of term @{term t} to be committed in slot @{term i}.\<close>

text \<open>The message @{term "ApplyCommit i t"} indicates that the value proposed by the master of
term @{term t} in slot @{term i} received a quorum of votes and is therefore committed.\<close>

text \<open>The message @{term Reboot} may be sent by any node to represent the restart of a node, which
loses any ephemeral state.\<close>

text \<open>The abstract model of Zen keeps track of the set of all messages that have ever been
sent, and asserts that this set obeys certain invariants, listed below. Further below, it will be
shown that these invariants imply that each slot obeys the @{term oneSlot} invariants above and
hence that each slot cannot see inconsistent committed values.\<close>

datatype Destination = Broadcast | OneNode Node

  sender :: Node

text \<open>It will be useful to be able to choose the optional term with the greater term,
so here is a function that does that.\<close>

  where

`^\Large\bf
TLA+ Model of the Elasticsearch data replication approach ^'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file provides a formal specification of how data replication will work in future versions of
Elasticsearch. We consider this work-in-progress: Model as well as implementation are still evolving
and might differ in substantial ways.

Introduction
------------

An index, which is a collection of documents, can be divided into multiple pieces, known as shards,
each of which can be stored on different machines. This approach of horizontal scaling enables Elasticsearch
to store much larger indices than could fit on a single machine. To ensure high availability and 
scale out read access, shards are usually also replicated onto multiple machines. The main copy 
is called the primary, all other copies are simply called replicas. The number of primary shards 
for an index is fixed at creation time, which allows to deterministically route requests for specific 
documents to the right shard, based on a hash of the document key (called the document "_id"). In the 
context of data replication, shards do their work independently from each other. The specification 
therefore only considers a single primary shard together with its copies, the replicas. It assumes a 
fixed set of nodes, each of which can host either the primary or one of the replicas. Shard allocation 
(i.e. which node has which shard) is dynamic and determined by the master, a process in the cluster 
that is backed by a consensus module. The TLA+ specification does not model the consensus module, it 
assumes that this component is working correctly. It shows however how data replication integrates with 
the consensus module to achieve its guarantees.

How data is replicated
----------------------

Clients send requests to an arbitrary node in the cluster. The node then routes the request to the
node in the cluster that has the primary shard for the corresponding document id. The document is
indexed at the primary and then replicated concurrently to the replicas. The replicas index the
document and confirm successful replication to the primary. The primary then acknowledges successful
replication to the client.

What's covered / not covered in this model
------------------------------------------

Failures covered by the model:

- node crashes

- disconnects between nodes on a per request basis

Also covered:

- cluster state batching / asynchronous application (each node applies the cluster state, which is
the state backed by the consensus model, at different points in time)

- network delays: messages can arrive out-of-order and be delayed

Limitations of the model:

- shard initialization / recovery is not modeled: the model initially assumes shards to be started.
When a shard fails, it is not reallocated / reassigned to another node but stays unassigned.
When a primary shard fails, a random replica is promoted to primary (if replica exists).

- only the transaction log is modeled. Lucene store as an optimistic consumer of the transaction log
is not modeled.

- adding nodes to the cluster is not modeled, whereas in Elasticsearch, nodes can dynamically 
be added to the cluster and those nodes will share in the hosting of shard data (shard data is 
moved to the new node through the process of recovery, mentioned above, which is also not modeled).

Other differences between model and current Java implementation:

- the Java implementation uses zero-based numbering for sequence numbers whereas the TLA+ model
starts from one, as this is the natural way to access the first element of a sequence in TLA+.

----

\* `^\Large\bf Constants ^'

\* The specification first defines the constants of the model, which amount to values or sets of
\* values that are fixed.

\* Set of node ids uniquely representing each data node in the cluster
CONSTANTS Nodes

\* Set of possible document ids (i.e. values for "_id" field)
CONSTANTS DocumentIds

(* Communication between the nodes is done using an RPC-like mechanism.
   For each request there is an associated response. In-flight requests / responses are modeled
   using messages, which are represented in TLA+ as record types. To distinguish requests from
   responses, the message record type contains a field "request" that denotes whether the message is
   a request or a response (takes as value one of {TRUE, FALSE}). It also contains the node id of
   the sender and receiver of the call (in the fields "source" and "dest"). The procedure that is
   called is found under the field "method".

   For example, sending a replication request from node n1 to n2 would yield the following message:
      [request   |-> TRUE,
       method    |-> Replication,
       source    |-> n1,
       dest      |-> n2]

   Responses also have a field "success" which indicates whether the call was successful
   or not (one of {TRUE, FALSE}).

   The model currently supports two RPC methods, one to replicate data from the primary to the 
   replicas and another one to trim the translog (explained later). The reroute logic for rerouting
   requests to the primary is not modeled as it has no impact on consistency/durability guarantees.
*) 
CONSTANTS Replication, TrimTranslog

(* Shard allocation is determined by the master and broadcasted to the data nodes in the form of a
   routing table, which is a map from node id to one of {Primary, Replica, Unassigned}, denoting 
   whether the respective node has the primary shard, a replica shard or no shard assigned at all.
*)
CONSTANTS Primary, Replica, Unassigned

\* The constant "Nil" denotes a non-existing value (e.g. in transaction log) or a place-holder for
\* a value that is to be computed.
CONSTANTS Nil

----

\* `^\Large\bf Variables ^'

\* The following describes the variable state of the model.

\* Set of in-flight requests and responses sent between data nodes.
VARIABLE messages

(* Beside managing and broadcasting the routing table, the master also tracks if
   a primary failed and/or a replica was promoted to primary, incrementing a number called the 
   "primary term" whenever this happens. Each new primary operates under a new term, allowing nodes
   to reject replication requests that come from a primary that has been demoted by the master.
   The routing table and primary term together form the cluster state, which is simply a record type
   containing both:

      [routingTable |->
          [n1 |-> Primary,
           n2 |-> Replica,
           n3 |-> Unassigned],
       primaryTerm |-> 1]

   The following variable represents the current cluster state on the master, which is not
   explicitly modeled as a node.
*)
VARIABLE clusterStateOnMaster

\* For simplicity we assume that each client (index) request uses a new unique value to be indexed.
\* This is just a natural number incremented on each client operation.
VARIABLE nextClientValue

\* The set of (acknowledged) client responses. Stored in a variable so that we can make assertions
\* about successfully acknowledged requests (e.g. that they've been successfully stored).
VARIABLE clientResponses

\* To improve readibility of the specification, the following placeholder clientVars can be used
\* instead of explicitly writing the two variables on the right hand side.
clientVars == <<nextClientValue, clientResponses>>

(* After indexing a document into the primary, it is replicated concurrently to the replicas.
   Writes are only acknowledged to the client after all replicas have acknowledged their writes to
   the primary. To correlate acknowledgements from multiple replicas for the same write on the
   primary, we use a unique request id that is shared by the concurrent replication requests going
   out to the replicas for each specific indexing operation on the primary. The responses carry the
   same request id as the requests they were originating from.

   This is just a natural number denoting the next available request id. It is incremented whenever
   a request id is used.
*)
VARIABLE nextRequestId


\* The following variables capture state on a per-node basis (maps with domain nodes).

(* Cluster states are determined by the master and broadcasted to nodes. Due to the distributed
   nature of the system, they can arrive and be applied at different times on the nodes. ES only
   guarantees that an older state is not applied on a node after a new one has been applied on the
   same node. It supports batching, however, so cluster states can be skipped if a newer has
   already arrived on a node before the old one has been processed on that node.

   Cluster states applied on each node are represented as a map from node id to cluster state that
   is currently applied on this node 
*)
VARIABLE clusterStateOnNode

(* The cluster state contains the current term number. Nodes might learn about the highest primary
   term number not only through cluster state updates, but also through other node-to-node
   communication such as replication requests. They store the most recent information (highest term
   they've heard about). The variable "currentTerm" is a map from node id to primary term number,
   representing the highest primary term number that is known to the node.
*)
VARIABLE currentTerm

(* The transaction log is a history of operations. The primary shard determines the order in which
   operations occur by assigning consecutive sequence numbers to the operations that are indexed.
   The sequence number represents a slot in the transaction log that is occupied by the operation.
   When a write on a primary is replicated to replicas, the replication request contains the sequence
   number that was assigned to this operation on the primary. The replica then assigns the operation
   to the same slot in its transaction log. Due to the concurrent nature of replication, replicas
   might fill these slots out-of-order. If the primary crashes or some replication requests don't make
   it to the replica, the replica can end up in a state where its transaction log has holes in it
   (slots that are not filled while subsequent slots are filled).

   Example of a transaction log on the primary and a replica:
   `.
                ---------------------
                | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
      primary   |-------------------|
                | x | x | x | x |   |
                ---------------------

                ---------------------
                | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
      replica   |-------------------|  (request for slot 2 is still in-flight)
                | x |   | x | x |   |
                ---------------------
   .'

   The transaction log is modeled as a map from node id to map from sequence number to record type
   consisting of document id, value to be stored, primary term and "pending confirmation" marker
   (more on that later).
*)
VARIABLE tlog

(* Having a transaction log in place, it is useful to know about the highest slot in the transaction
   log where all slots below it have been successfully replicated to all replicas, i.e. the common
   history shared by all in-sync shard copies. It is useful because in the case where a primary
   fails, a replica which is promoted to primary knows that it has to only worry about being out of sync
   with other replicas on slots that are beyond this slot. The primary is in charge of tracking
   this information, also called global checkpoint. For this, replica shards share information with the
   primary on the highest slot they have filled where all lower slots are filled as well, called the
   local checkpoint. The primary then establishes the global checkpoint as the minimum of the local
   checkpoint value received from all shard copies (including its own local checkpoint) and broadcasts 
   this information to the replicas.

   The global checkpoint is modeled as a map from node id to sequence number.
*)
VARIABLE globalCheckPoint

(* The local checkpoint is modeled as a map from node id (node that is doing the tracking)
   to node id (node for which the local checkpoint is being tracked) to sequence number.

   Only the primary maintains the local checkpoints from all replicas, but because of the possibility of 
   the primary changing over time, and in order to separate the state for each node more clearly, we maintain 
   a node id to local checkpoint map for each node in the cluster.
*)
VARIABLE localCheckPoint

\* The placeholder "nodeVars" is used as a shorthand for all node variables
nodeVars == <<clusterStateOnNode, tlog, localCheckPoint, globalCheckPoint, currentTerm>>

\* `^\Large\bf Helper functions on translog ^'

(* When a request comes to a primary, it has to select a slot (the sequence number) to put the
   request into. It corresponds to the slot in the transaction log right after the highest slot
   that's filled.
   The following function yields the highest slot that's filled in the transaction log, or 0 if
   no such slot exists.
*)
MaxSeq(ntlog) == Max(DOMAIN ntlog \cup {0})

(* `^\bf\large MaxConfirmedSeq ^'
   The local checkpoint is defined as the highest slot in the translog, where all lower slots
   are filled. It is not only holes in the translog that prevent the local checkpoint from moving foward. 
   We actually want to prevent the local checkpoint from moving past slots which are filled but marked as 
   pending confirmation. Pending entries in the translog are entries that appear after the global checkpoint that are not
   allowed to contribute to the advancement of the local checkpoint until a resyncing phase happens due to 
   the primary shard changing nodes. Translog entries thus have a "pc" (pending confirmation) marker
   (\in {TRUE, FALSE}) that says whether the local checkpoint can move past them.
   This function yields highest sequence number which are not pending confirmation and where
   all lower slots are not pending confirmation either.
   Yields 0 if no such number exists.
